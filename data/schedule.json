By building next to a castle, the player will earn gold at the end of the game, but the most gold will be earned by meeting the conditions of the three Kingdom Builder cards; these three cards (from a total of ten in the game) specify the conditions that must be met in order to earn the much-desired gold, such as earning gold for your settlements built next to water hexes or having the majority of settlements in a sector of the board.","1-Jan-13"],["Saturday",7,"7:00pm","BG","VCON 2","DEMO - VCON presents: Carcassone","By Cam Brenner of VCon\nDay: Saturday \nStart Time: 7:00pm\nNumber of participants: 2 to 5\n\nCarcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it.

Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner. \n\nDuring a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: \"Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?\" or \"Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?\" Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.","1-Jan-13"],["Saturday",7,"7:00pm","BG","BG03\nto\nBG10","Dominion Tournament","By Starlit Citadel\nSponsored by: Rio Grande Games\nDay: Saturday\nStart Time: Time: 7:00pm\nPrice: $5.00\nNumber of participants: Max of 32, Min of 8 players\n\nStarlit Citadel is hosting a Dominion tournament which is sponsored by Rio Grande Games.

If multiple characters have equal lives and damage, Sudden Death will determine the winner. Items are turned off, matches will be seeded randomly.\n\nMeta Knight is banned. Stalling is banned. (Stalling is defined as any action that deliberately avoids all conflict as to make the game unplayable. Running from an opponent to get to a better position is not considered stalling, but using chain grabs infinitely against a wall beyond 300% or using Sonic\u2019s homing attack repeatedly underneath the stage is). Any action that prevents the game from continuing results in a forfeiture of the match for the offender.

What is a Brony and Pegasister? Why does a cartoon, often seen as something only for little girls, have such a strong fan base among men, with the average age of the male fan at 21-years-old? We will attempt to dispel some of the myths about Bronies, and try to create a conversation about how we, as a geek community, can better support this area of fandom.","1-Jan-13"],[null,null,null,null,null,"BG = ","Board Game",null],[null,null,null,null,null,"EG = ","Electonic Game",null],[null,null,null,null,null,"Minis = ","Miniatures",null],[null,null,null,null,null,"RPG = ","Role-Playing Game",null],[null,null,null,null,null,"TCG = ","Trading Card Game",null],[null,null,null,null,null,"WS\/P = ","Workshop\/Panel",null],[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null]]},{"title":"Sheet2","data":[[null]]},{"title":"Sheet3","data":[[null]]}]}
